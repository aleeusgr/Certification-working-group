Following the current trend in duscussing governance and the theme of the Cardano Summit hackathon I it is good to allocate some resources towards the work described here.

Definition 13. A blockchain governance system satisfies the property of accountability if whenever participants bring in a change, they are held individually responsible for it in a clearly defined way by the platform. [1]

Considering an app to be a change to the ecosystem our first intention could be to hold auditors accountable for the work they do, therefore to recognize the need to have an insurance fund to compensate community members who had losses incured from hacks in the network. Such fund would be funded from the main treasury and by yearly membership fees paid by auditing firms. 

However we should be aware of accountability vs utility tradeoffs, in other words with such mechanism in place audit fees would make development on Cardano inaccessible to developers, thus stifling the growth of the ecosystem.

Therefore a solution that is less intrusive is needed. We can improve accountability by providing open access to information about what auditors are doing and why.

I propose to focus on a How-to, a tutorial, an explanation or a reference material about Certification and audit.

What is required is a code repository that will demonstrate minimal smart contract functionality and satisfy requirements for lowest level of certification; along with it a text document describing decision points, errors that are costly at laters stages but could be mitigated early, and general approach to development focused on quality of the end product.

The goal is to democratize access to Catalyst, reducing the amount of resources needed to get from an idea to user testing a product.

Preliminary work should be completed by Fund 11, and if the community decides to fund this project in F11 - the main work will take place in 2024.
