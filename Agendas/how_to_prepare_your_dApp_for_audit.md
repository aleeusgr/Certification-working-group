I propose to focus on a How-to, a tutorial, an explanation or a reference material about Certification and audit.

What is required is a code repository that will demonstrate minimal smart contract functionality and satisfy requirements for lowest level of certification; along with it a text document describing decision points, errors that are costly at laters stages but could be mitigated early, and general approach to development focused on quality of the end product.

The goal is to democratize access to Catalyst, reducing the amount of resources needed to get from an idea to user testing a product.

Preliminary work should be completed by Fund 11, and if the community decides to fund this project in F11 - the main work will take place in 2024.
